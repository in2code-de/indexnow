# TYPO3 Extension `indexnow`

TYPO3 extension to inform a search engine about modified content and to
speed up reindexing. For now Bing is used as default endpoint, which itself
shares this information with Yandex and other participating search engines.

The [IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/) specification is used for this purpose.

> The extension is in a heavy development phase. Breaking changes can be expected
> between releases.
